Parser for JavaScript
---------------------

Based (loosely) on language-python

How to build
------------

Library:

cabal clean && cabal configure && cabal build

Tests:

cabal clean && cabal configure -fbuildtests && cabal build

Running the tests

./dist/build/runtests/runtests


To debug the grammar

happy -iparse.txt -g -a  -d src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar.y 

This generates src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar.hs, delete this
when done with the debug version


UTF8/Unicode version 

This requires https://github.com/jyp/Alex, in particular the utf8
branch, to generate the Lexer.hs file

$ git clone https://github.com/jyp/Alex.git
$ cd Alex
$ git checkout utf8
$ cabal install

This will put a utf8 enabled alex in ~/.cabal/bin

To switch back to the standard version, 

$ cabal install --reinstall alex

Changes

0.0.3 Support for unicode in source. At the moment it only supports
UTF8 encoding, does not recognise byte order marks or UTF-16/UTF-32

0.0.2 Multiline comments were processed in greedy form, now end of
comment recognised properly. Thanks to Tony Morris for reporting this.

0.0.1 Initial release
