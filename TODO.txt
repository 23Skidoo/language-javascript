Things to do

Useful resource: http://sideshowbarker.github.com/es5-spec

1. Work in unicode support.

Use the utf8 branch of the following project

2. Separate out the different versions of JavaScript. 

Necessary?  Depends what this tool is used for.  Current assumption is
that it is fed well-formed JS, and generates an AST for further
manipulation.

3. Simplify the AST. *JSElement at the very least is redundant.

4. Clarify the external interfaces required.

5. Process comments. Some kinds of hooks exist, but they are essentially discarded.

*6. Work in the future reserved words, ECMAScript edition 3, 7.5.3

*7. Make BOM parse as whitespace, as required by edition 5.

8. String literals for ed 5 - continuation chars etc.

*9. IdentifierName is union of Identifier and reserved word. i.e. Can
use reserved word as a name in certain contexts. Damn.

10. Sort out [no line terminator here] in PostfixExpression

11. Export AST as JSON or XML

  @paul_houle better tools come from the languages making their ast available, 
  as json or xml: gcc --astxml a.c
