Things to do

1. Work in unicode support.

Use the utf8 branch of the following project

2. Separate out the different versions of JavaScript. 

Necessary?  Depends what this tool is used for.  Current assumption is
that it is fed well-formed JS, and generates an AST for further
manipulation.

3. Simplify the AST. JSElement at the very least is redundant.

4. Clarify the external interfaces required.

5. Process comments. Some kinds of hooks exist, but they are essentially discarded.
